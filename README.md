Audio signal classification using deep learning algorithms


In this thesis we compare the performance of multiple feature parameters for environmental sound classification problems by developing multiple evaluating models. Specifically, as a representation of 2 different datasets, we used waveforms , log-mel spectrograms and short-time Fourier transforms, and finally we set 4 different experiments that actually were divided in two categories. For the first one (experiments 1 and 2), one-dimensional features were used and 2 different types of models were developed, CNNs and RNNs. As for the second one, 2-dimensional features were used, and CNN models were developed. In conclusion,  the results showed………. We found that
